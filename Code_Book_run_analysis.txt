There are 2 parts to this code book
1. NOTES for TOTAL merged file that includes data from test and train
2. NOTES for EXTRACT file that extracts only the measures that are mean or std


Since part 1. is very long be sure to scroll down to find the much shorter part 2.

1.NOTES for TOTAL merged file that includes data from test and train

The test & train data are merged into a data set called total.
Column names are transformed to be in regular language.
Duplicate columns have been deleted.
These map to the original data sets with the following modifications:
Original - ^t is changed to time
Original - ^f is changed to frequency
Original - acc is changed to accelartion
Original - gyro is changed to gyroscope
Original - mag is changed to magnitude

In addition, the activities have changed from numeric factors 1-6 to real language
1- Walking
2 Walking upstairs
3 walking downstairs
4 sitting
5 standing
6 laying

2. NOTES for EXTRACT File

The file called extract includes the following variables.
These were all pulled from the total (merged) file on the basis that they reflect mean and standard deviation measures.

Note that items 49-55 are variables derived from gravity mean, and are therefore do not reflect the same sort of calculation
that appears in the other variables in this list.
